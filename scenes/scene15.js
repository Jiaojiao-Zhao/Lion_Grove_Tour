            "text": "Lion Grove Rockery is one of the most tortuous and complex examples of piled mountains in Chinese classical gardens. When Jiushifeng Garden was built at the end of Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of Ming Dynasty, it collected a large number of relics of 'flower stone Class' in the Northern Song Dynasty. After the exquisite conception of the stone stacking master, the rockery group was stacked with 'transparent, leaking, thin and crease' Taihu stone. There are stone peaks and stalagmites on the rockery, and ancient trees and pines grow between the stone crevices. A stalagmite hangs with garrote. Rockery is divided into upper, middle and lower three layers, with a total of 9 mountain roads and 21 holes. On the top of the rockery, stands the famous five peaks: the lion peak in the middle, the Hui peak in the east, and the Tuyue peak in the west. On both sides is Liyu, Angxiao Peak and dozens of small peaks. After drilling through the rockery, Zhu Bingjing, a scholar in the Qing Dynasty, wrote: The opposite stone is blocked, and the way back is suddenly through. Such as wearing a few beads, the winding potential is embedded, such as every eight matrix, infinite variations. So the road forgot to enter and exit, new art fans west east. The friends are scattered, and the sound is not met."

Hanging inside the pavilion are the four bold characters'Righteousness Stands Firm' (正气凛然)—a tribute to Wen Tianxiang's unwavering patriotism. During the Yuan Zhizhi era (1275), Wen Tianxiang served as the governor of Suzhou, where he led the resistance against the Yuan forces, earning deep respect from the local people. Inside the pavilion, a stone stele bears an inscription of Wen Tianxiang’s calligraphic masterpiece, the Plum Blossom Poem (梅花诗) in wild cursive script: 'In stillness, all movement ceases, With noble bearing, the heart remains pure. Who shall record the beauty of spring? The plum blossoms stand proudly in the vase.' This pavilion serves as a monument to his legacy, embodying the enduring spirit of loyalty and integrity."

            "text": "The Xiaofang Pavilion (小方厅) derives its name, 'Yuanshe Chengqu' (园涉成趣), from a verse in Tao Yuanming's 'Return Home' (归去来兮辞): 'The garden is delightful with frequent visits, though the door is set, it remains often closed.' (园日涉以成趣，门虽设而常关). The two large square windows on either side of the pavilion serve as framed views (框景)—a technique in garden design that integrates natural scenery into architectural elements. The eastern window frames a wintersweet painting, while the western window captures a rocky mountain dwelling scene, presenting picturesque compositions akin to traditional Chinese paintings. To the northeast, a corridor leads to the residential quarters, where brick carvings on the corridor wall bear inscriptions such as 'Xi Lu' (息庐, a place for restful retreat) and 'An Yin' (安隐, a tranquil sanctuary), emphasizing the pavilion’s role as a peaceful haven. Additionally, the bricks are engraved with 'Yi Jia Shou Fu' (宜家受福, blessings upon the household) and 'Yi Jia' (宜家, harmonious home life), echoing the Confucian ideal of domestic harmony. This technique of framed scenery and poetic inscription is a hallmark of Suzhou's classical gardens. Similar framed views can be found in Lingering Garden (留园) and Master of the Nets Garden (网师园), where windows and doorways create natural paintings that evolve with the seasons. Likewise, poetic inscriptions are prevalent in Humble Administrator’s Garden (拙政园), showing the scholarly tradition of using literature to complement the landscape."

The Imperial Stele Pavilion (御碑亭) houses poems composed by Qianlong during his second southern tour, which marked his first visit to this renowned garden. The pavilion serves as a historical testament to Emperor Qianlong’s deep appreciation and poetic celebration of the garden’s beauty and cultural significance."

Stepping into this serene space, one is immersed in the poetic essence of: ‘Leaning alone against the slender bamboo, whom do I await? Watching the drifting clouds, my thoughts are never far away.’ The dappled shadows of bamboo and the gentle rustling of the wind evoke a profound sense of Zen tranquility. This setting reflects the Buddhist aesthetic often found in Suzhou gardens, where nature and architecture harmonize to create a space for quiet contemplation. Similar Zen-inspired elements can be seen in the Pavilion of Restful Thoughts (依依望翠亭) in Lingering Garden (留园) and the Bamboo Pavilion (竹外一枝轩) in Master of the Nets Garden (网师园), where bamboo and water features create a poetic retreat for the mind."

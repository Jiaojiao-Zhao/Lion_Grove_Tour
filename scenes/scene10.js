            "text": "In Chinese traditional culture, bamboo symbolizes integrity, humility, and resilience, while in Buddhism, it represents Zen philosophy and wisdom. Lion Grove Garden (狮子林) is renowned for its rockeries, and the bamboo groves within the garden not only create a harmonious spatial rhythm but also add a natural charm among the rock formations. Originally established as a monastic garden by the monk Wenli, many of its landscapes reflect Zen aesthetics. Bamboo, with its pure and unimpeded nature, symbolizes a tranquil and detached Zen mind, embodying the emptiness, simplicity, and unyielding spirit that Zen Buddhism pursues. As the bamboo leaves sway in the wind, they complement the rugged rockeries and winding paths of Lion Grove Garden, adding a sense of movement and vitality to the landscape. Similarly, in Humble Administrator’s Garden (拙政园), the bamboo groves set against Yuanxiang Hall (远香堂) highlight the serene elegance of Jiangnan classical gardens. In Lingering Garden (留园), bamboo grows alongside Taihu stones, creating the unique aesthetic of 'Slender (bamboo), Leaky (Taihu stone holes), and Transparent (rockery scenery)', a defining characteristic of Suzhou garden artistry. In Master of the Nets Garden (网师园), the interplay of bamboo shadows and rippling water evokes a deep Zen ambiance, as if stepping into a Song dynasty landscape painting, where nature and art merge into a poetic retreat."

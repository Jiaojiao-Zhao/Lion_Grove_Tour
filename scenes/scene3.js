            "text": "At the center of the main hall, a painting titled ‘Cang Song Tu’ (苍松图, The Ancient Pines) by Suzhou painter Zhang Jixin is prominently displayed. The painting features five towering pine trees, subtly alluding to the garden’s historical name, ‘Wusong Garden’ (五松园, Five Pines Garden)—a name that predates its current identity as Lion Grove Garden (狮子林). Above the painting hangs a plaque inscribed with ‘Yunlin Yi Yun’ (云林逸韵, The Graceful Charm of Yunlin), written by Gu Tinglong, a renowned modern bibliographer. This phrase pays homage to Ni Zan (倪瓒), a celebrated painter and poet of the late Yuan dynasty, whose masterpiece, ‘Painting of Lion Grove Garden’ (狮子林图), is now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taiwan. The inscription reflects admiration for Ni Zan’s transcendent artistic style, which embodies the elegant and otherworldly essence of classical literati gardens."

According to the story, Shenguang, a man from Luoyang, traveled to Mount Song to seek Bodhidharma as his master. On that day, heavy snow covered his knees, yet Bodhidharma simply said:‘When the snow turns red, Zen shall be passed on.’ At that moment, Shenguang attained sudden enlightenment. To prove his unwavering commitment, he drew his blade and cut his arm, staining the snow red. Seeing his disciple’s determination, Bodhidharma accepted him, giving him the Buddhist name Huixue (慧雪)—a testament to the saying: ‘With absolute sincerity, even metal and stone can be pierced.’",

In the left corner, a three-legged toad symbolizes the folk legend of Liu Hai playing with the golden toad (‘刘海戏金蟾’), an auspicious sign of wealth and prosperity. In front of the hall, a peculiar rock formation named ‘Ox Eating a Crab’ (牛吃蟹) depicts an illogical scene. In Suzhou dialect, this phrase humorously refers to forcing oneself to do something one is not good at, reflecting the local wisdom embedded in garden design and rock symbolism."

            "text": "The Zhenqu Pavilion (真趣亭) is located on the south bank of the pond, facing the artificial mountain. It is relatively large in scale with a unique architectural structure. The front two pillars of the pavilion are basket-hung columns (花篮吊柱), while the rear section is enclosed with gauze screens to form an inner corridor. The ceiling is richly decorated, with beams featuring polygonal latticework (菱角轩) and a boat-shaped canopy (船蓬轩). The entire structure is adorned with intricately carved beams, painted ornaments, and gilded designs. The short pillars of the goose-leg chairs (鹅胫椅) are topped with seated lion sculptures. A plaque inscribed with “Zhenqu” (真趣, True Delight) in gold on a green background, bearing the calligraphy of Emperor Qianlong, hangs inside the pavilion. This ornate pavilion design, combining structural elegance, decorative craftsmanship, and imperial inscriptions, is a feature found in many Suzhou classical gardens. For example, the Pavilion of Surging Waves (沧浪亭) in Canglang Pavilion (沧浪亭) also integrates poetic calligraphy with architectural beauty, while the Fragrant Isle Pavilion (香洲) in Humble Administrator’s Garden (拙政园) exhibits exquisite painted beams and gilded ornaments. The technique of using gauze partitions to create semi-private spaces is similarly employed in Lingering Garden (留园), enhancing both spatial depth and visual elegance."
